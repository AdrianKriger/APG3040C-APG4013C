Four different spatial interpolation methods using the [meuse](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/sp/html/meuse.html) data set and the gstat package. 

meuse: gives locations and topsoil heavy metal concentrations, along with a number of soil and landscape variables at the observation locations, collected in a flood plain of the river Meuse, near the village of Stein (NL). Heavy metal concentrations are from composite samples of an area of approximately 15 m x 15 m.

These interpolation methods are:
1) Trend surface analysis,
2) Regression modelling,
3) Inverse distance weighting (IDW) and
4) Kriging.

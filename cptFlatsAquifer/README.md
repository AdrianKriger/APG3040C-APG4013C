**Trend surfaces using R**

A trend surface is a map of some continuous variable, computed as a function of the co√∂rdinates. This corresponds to the concept of a geographic trend, where the variable changes its value along a geographic gradient.

We use a dataset that is well-suited to illustrate the concepts of trend surface: a set of observations on the elevation above mean sea level of the top of the Cape Town aquifer, South Africa measured at ~ 30 wells.
